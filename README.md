# Requirements-Analysis-for-humanoid-robot

This is requirements analysis for adding a new feature (coffee serving) to our humanoid 
robot. It includes all the departments that work on the robot: Mechanical Engineering 
Department, Electronics and Power Department, Robotics and AI Department and IOT 
and software development. As an industrial engineer, I should have a clear idea about
each department tasks, and this obviously made it easy to analyze and discuss 
their work.
                 
               
## Goals:
The goal of this requirements analysis is to distinguish 
between functional requirements and non-functional requirements in each department.


## Observations:
In each department, functional requirements is more than non-functional requirements 
due to the importance. 
Functional requirements is surly more important and the focus is 
on them.
